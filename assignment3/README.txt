1. Update `run_experiment.py` to use your data sets for dataset1 and dataset2. Also set `best_nn_params` for your data sets (lines 94 and 101).
2. Run the various experiments (perhaps via `python run_experiment.py --all`)
3. Plot the results so far via `python run_experiment.py --plot`
4. Update the dim values in `run_clustering.sh` based on the optimal values found in 2 (perhaps by looking at the scree graphs)
5. Run `run_clustering.sh`
6. One final run to plot the rest `python run_experiment.py --plot`
